Welcome to the "Mapping the World with React and Leaflet" repository! 🚀🔍 This repository contains the code for an upcoming captivating article series that explores the powerful combination of Leaflet.js and React to create interactive maps and geospatial web applications.

## Article Series Overview 📚

In this series, we embark on an exciting journey of map visualization using Leaflet.js and React. From rendering a simple map to adding markers, polygons, and handling user interactions, we cover the art of geospatial web development step by step. Perfect for developers of all levels, the series offers insights into customizing maps, working with external data, and adding interactivity.
